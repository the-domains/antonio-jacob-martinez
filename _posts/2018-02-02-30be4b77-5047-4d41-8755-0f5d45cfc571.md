  Work in Progress. I am currently in search of additional subjects for a
  photography project that involves making portraits of DNA Donors. It entails
  the production of a customized quilt, based on a small portion of oneâ€™s mtDNA
  (provided by 23&Me), to be used as a custom backdrop. I have a system set in
  place to keep the DNA confidential, so that even I do not know your ACGT
  nucleotide sequence. I need 800 of the 16000 nucleotide base pairs to
  construct a queen size quilt.

## Call for Subjects

Work in Progress. I am currently in search of additional subjects for a photography project that involves making portraits of DNA Donors. It entails the production of a customized quilt, based on a small portion of one's mtDNA (provided by 23&Me), to be used as a custom backdrop. I have a system set in place to keep the DNA confidential, so that even I do not know your ACGT nucleotide sequence. I need 800 of the 16000 nucleotide base pairs to construct a queen size quilt.

There is zero cost. I will construct the DNA quilt and drive to the subject's hometown for the final photography portrait.

If you are a DNA donor or donor-conceived adult and wish to be part of this series, please contact me at antoniojacobmartinez@gmail.com
