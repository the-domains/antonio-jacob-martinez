Work in Progress. I am currently in search of additional subjects for a photography project that involves making portraits of DNA Donors. It entails the production of a customized quilt, based on a small portion of one's mtDNA (provided by 23&Me), to be used as a custom backdrop. I have a system set in place to keep the DNA confidential. I only need 800 of the 16000 nucleotide base pairs to construct a queen size quilt. 

There is zero cost. I will construct the DNA quilt and drive to the subject's hometown for the final photography portrait. If you are a donor-conceived adult and wish to be part of this series, please do not hesitate. If you are interested, you may contact me at antoniojacobmartinez@gmail.com
