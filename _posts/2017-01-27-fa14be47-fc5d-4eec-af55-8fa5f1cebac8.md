# How to Hug and Other Sublimations of Men

These expressive photographs capture moments between the exchange of pain and power between two men who display symbols of fearlessness and valor through their actions, but also on their skin and clothing apparel. The hand-applied surface abrasions and ink removal around the bodies of the athletes suggests both movement and men physically sublimating into something greater than what can be achieved outside the arena.

Having experienced my first cagefight last year, I gained a greater appreciation for what it means to experience life on a more physical level when compared to my daily activities as a professor in a classroom. As a professor, the pursuit of enriching the mind through observation and study, without firsthand physical experience, became the path to knowledge. I needed more than to speculate and to observe as an uninitiated outsider; I w anted firsthand experience in pursuing a physical challenge that seemed both admirable and deplorable.
