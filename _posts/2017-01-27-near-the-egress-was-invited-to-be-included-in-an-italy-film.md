## **WATER **

This black and white panorama, created with an iPhone and later processed with Lightroom, was selected for the Midwest Center of Photography's Water exhibition, juried by Linda Robinson. The access point to the top of the Kinkaid Lake cliffs requires a long drive through the backroads of Southern Illinois and about a 2 mile hike along a farm field and through a forest. It's a secluded spot well worth the journey with friends.

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ceec6fcf3cfe876af53bad67aaaa613111af4127.jpg" /><h1>Near the Egress with Antonio Martinez | Grand Center - The Intersection of Art and Life</h1><p>Near the Egress began as a "what if" experiment in which Martinez's interest in modern dryplate tintypes at that time in 2005 was later inspired by John Aasp's lecture on the properties of a moving still image and influenced by Stan Brakhage's experimental films. Near the Egress is a three part series comprised of the original modern dryplate tintype, the stop-animation video, and digital images that combine the details of the black and white negative and the ephemeral effects produced by the tintype.</p></article>
