## WATER (2017)

This black and white panorama, created with an iPhone and later processed with Lightroom, was selected for the Midwest Center of Photography's Water exhibition, juried by Linda Robinson. The access point to the top of the Kinkaid Lake cliffs requires a long drive through the backroads of Southern Illinois and about a 2 mile hike along a farm field and through a forest. It's a secluded spot well worth the journey with friends.
