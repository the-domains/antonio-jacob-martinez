# Holy X and 9th Ward: Post Katrina

Holy Cross and the 9th Ward parishes endured catastrophic flooding by Hurricane Katrina in 2005\. Two years later, I travelled with the students and faculty of SIU's School of Architecture to document and to survey the remaining homes in both Holy Cross and the Ninth Ward. Seeing the destruction firsthand was overwhelming. I had to travel light and made the decision to bring along a digital camera with a Circular 8mm fisheye lens and attempt HDR imagery for the Holy X imagery and surreal digital panorama techniques for the 9th Ward.

## Holy X

My attention was drawn to the "X"s spray painted on the faces of the homes by the National Guard. The numbers indicated the date of search and rescue efforts, along with the number of people and animals found, deceased, and rescued. It was actually a sunny day when I made these HDR images, but I choose to remove the blue sky, for what I saw that remained in the neighborhood was general sadness and gloom. I understand the faces of these homes no different than a person's actual face. Even after two years of Katrina, the "X"s remained in clear sight. I interpreted these markings no different than a scar that hasn't healed or as way to raise an unforgettable awareness surrounding the stalled efforts in revitalizing this ward. Some residents chose to keep the Xs in plain sight, while others chose to repaint and to rebuild their homes.

## The Ninth Ward

Across the boulevard from the Holy Cross Parrish, the Ninth Ward sat in complete silence. The homes that directly faced the levee wall were missing, along with the several homesites along adjacent streets. The only indication that a house was once stood in any of these locations was the address house number spray painted near the foundation. I used the 180º degree fisheye lens and photographed to the left, center, and right of where the home would have been standing. The intention was to produce an effect that makes the levee wall feel like an encompassing monolithic structure designed to quarantine a community.
