# Holy X and 9th Ward: Post Katrina

Holy Cross Parrish was flooded by Hurrican Katrina. I travelled with the students and faculty of SIU's School of Architecture to document and to survey the remaining homes in both Holy Cross and the Ninth Ward. My attention was drawn to the "X"s spray painted on the faces of the homes. The numbers indicated the date of search and rescue efforts, along with the number of people and animals found, deceased, and rescued.
