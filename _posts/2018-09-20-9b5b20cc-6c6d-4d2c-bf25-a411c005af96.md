  This experimental video is comprised of over 800 dryplate tintypes of the
  Ringling Bros circus. The first step involved exposing 16 rolls of black and
  white film and push processing the development due to the low light
  conditions.  Each negative was printed as a black and white positive, which
  then was contact printed onto a modern dryplate tintype. Not every attempt
  yielded a successful tintype during this contact printing phase. There were
  several obstacles, for the process was very finicky. Martinez kept the
  successful and unsuccessful tintypes and used them in the final edit of the
  video.  Because his film camera captured at such a low frame per second,
  Martinez used photoshop to create "faux" frames, for the motion of the video
  was too choppy and discordant.  On average, for every bona fide frame captured
  in camera, Martinez generated/composited about seven faux inter-frames, which
  were then printed on inkjet paper and contact printed onto a dry plate.  This
  allowed for smoother movements and transitions. In short, this video was more
  work than what Martinez I had imagined, but well worth it.

## The Modern Dryplate Tintypes

Not every tintype was perfect. Each tintype was edited to yield some level of cohesiveness on a visual level. ![Scanning 800-1000 tintypes was time intensive. This is an example of a raw unedited scan.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6a88942b-634d-40fe-9cc5-8e2bea285003.jpg)

## Hybrids - Scanned Negatives + Modern Tintype Composites

Since Martinez is a curious breed of photographer, he decided to explore the idea of combining the original negative and its' corresponding tintype, all in order to generate a new aesthetic. Below are a few samples of this stylistic choice. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/95372be2-4bc7-4443-9d0a-729f5f795467.jpg)
