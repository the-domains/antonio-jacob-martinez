            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE MALE GAZE </strong><br>A small selection of images from the How to Hug and Other Sublimations of Men series was featured in two exhibitions a the Seattle-based gallery.  The first exhibit was entitled the Male Gaze, which is a twist on the traditional feminist interpretation of the â€œmale gaze.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.gallery1of1.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=83" title="The Male Gaze">Click to see examples from the Male Gaze Exhibition</a></p>,<p><strong>WATER </strong><br>This black and white panorama, created with an iPhone and later processed with Lightroom, was selected for the Midwest Center of Photography's Water exhibition, juried by Linda Robinson. The access point to the top of the Kinkaid Lake cliffs requires a long drive through the backroads of Southern Illinois and about a 2 mile hike along a farm field and through a forest. It's a secluded spot well worth the journey with friends.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/70c8cd8c-a42a-46d5-9725-652527fc3907.jpg" title="Tank, Kellen, and Jennifer at Kinkaid Lake cliffs, July 2015">,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b4464a7ae3a0b70a2a3c7397b3e8029e028e0594.jpg"><h1>Water</h1><p>We sustain ourselves through its consumption, and frolic in bodies of it. We gaze at the vastness of oceans&apos; expanse. Water is crucial in our world; from the rain nourishing our land, to the water we use everyday in our homes.</p></article>]]></description>
