I am currently in search of additional subjects for a photography project that involves making portraits of DNA Donors. It entails the production of a customized quilt, based on a small portion of one’s mtDNA (provided by 23&amp;Me), to be used as a custom backdrop. I have a system set in place to keep the DNA confidential, so that even I do not know your ACGT nucleotide sequence. I need 800 of the 16000 nucleotide base pairs to construct a queen size quilt.</p>,<p>There is zero cost. I will construct the DNA quilt and drive to the subject’s hometown for the final photography portrait.</p>,<p>If you are a DNA donor or donor-conceived adult and wish to be part of this series, please contact me at antoniojacobmartinez@gmail.com</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab8afae8-6168-456b-afe2-4434818f76be.jpg" alt="My sewing machine and triangle patterns.">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/16c67f3c-890a-47df-b3d2-a4168ca86e59.jpg" alt="An example of how the patterning of nucleotides as square fabric swatches works.

            <title><![CDATA[How to Hug and Other Sublimations of Men]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>How to Hug and Other Sublimations of Men</h1>,<p>These expressive photographs capture moments between the exchange of pain and power between two men who display symbols of fearlessness and valor through their actions, but also on their skin and clothing apparel. The hand-applied surface abrasions and ink removal around the bodies of the athletes suggests both movement and men physically sublimating into something greater than what can be achieved outside the arena.</p>,<p>Having experienced my first cagefight last year, I gained a greater appreciation for what it means to experience life on a more physical level when compared to my daily activities as a professor in a classroom. As a professor, the pursuit of enriching the mind through observation and study, without firsthand physical experience, became the path to knowledge. I needed more than to speculate and to observe as an uninitiated outsider; I w anted firsthand experience in pursuing a physical challenge that seemed both admirable and deplorable.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/384b6a89009ac0c281217a1c0e828f5ce6012328.jpg" alt="Installation at Creighton University, Omaha, NE">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/886612e0-a47a-405a-80fe-180c22503c81.jpg" alt="Two cagefighters clinch and grapple in attempts to establish a dominant position over the other.">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df064504-2679-4a32-a132-8971934c7a47.jpg" alt="A former marine tries to avoid a takedown from his opponent.">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/58900adf-ca39-4d6e-b458-9ad373fa060d.jpg" alt="A young teen fighter stares directly at the camera while listening to his walk out music.
